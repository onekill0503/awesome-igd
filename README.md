# Awesome IGD Android Application
Simple Android Application for Downloading Instagram Content made with React-native

# Descripttion About this Application
I just learned about React Native and don't know what to make with React Native. and I got the idea to create an Android application that is used to download Instagram content (not private content) automatically by simply copying the link content from the Instagram application. This application is still under development and will continue to be developed

# Usage
how to use this application is quite easy, by simply activating the application by pressing the power button on the application and closing the application. the application will run on the background. after that, find an Instagram post via the instagram application where you want to download the content such as pictures or videos. just copy the link from the post instagram the notification will appear to download the file. click the notification to be directed to this application then download the desired image or video
